# Diabetes-prediction-Model
This project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset to predict whether a patient is diabetic. Multiple classification techniques are implemented, including KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and K-Means Clustering for unsupervised pattern recognition. Models are compared using accuracy and confusion matrices.
